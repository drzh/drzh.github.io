I am currently a computational biologist at [UT Southwestern Medical Center](https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/). My recent research strives to understand the genetic mechanisms of human diseases using large-scale data. My interests include, but not limited to the following areas:
  - Genetics of human diseases
  - Cancer genetics
  - Population genetics
  - Development of methods to analyze large-scale sequencing data
