### Projects at UT Southwestern Medical Center, 2016/06 - present


### Projects at University of Michigan, 2012/04 – 2016/01
1. **HUNT Whole Genome Sequencing Project**  
    The purpose of this on-going project is to perform whole genome sequencing in 2,202 samples (1,100 MI cases and 1,102 controls) from Norway, and provide a reference panel for association study, population genetics study and imputation. I am leading the analysis of this project, and have performed read-mapping, genotype-calling, quality control and statistical analysis of the sequencing data.

2. **GeneZoom**  
    GeneZoom is a convenient tool to visualize the association test results at both variant and gene levels. GeneZoom can be used as a program or in our website interface. I participated in the design, development and testing of GeneZoom. The manuscript is in preparation.

3. **PUUMA myocardial infarction (MI) and plasma lipid association study**  
    The goal of this project is to identify variants associated with MI and plasma lipid levels in a Chinese population. 10,030 samples from China were genotyped using Illumina Human Exome-chip. I performed genotype-calling, quality control and computational analysis for these data. We identified four novel Asian-specific variants associated with plasma lipid values. A first author paper has been submitted.

4. **NHLBI Exome sequencing project (ESP)**  
    The goal of the NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) is to discover novel genes and mechanisms contributing to heart, lung and blood disorders by pioneering the application of next-generation sequencing of the protein coding regions of the human genome. I performed gene-based burden tests for LDL-cholesterol based on whole exome sequencing data of 5,500 samples. We identified several low-frequency variants with large effect on LDL-cholesterol. A co-first author paper has been published in The American Journal of Human Genetics.

5. **HUNT MI and plasma lipid association study**  
    The goal of this project is to identify variants associated with MI and plasma lipid levels in Norwegians. 6,000 samples from Norway were genotyped using Illumina Human Exome-chip. I performed genotype-calling, quality control and computational analysis for these data. We identified a new causal coding variant in TM6SF2 associated with total cholesterol, and our collaborators verified its function. Two co-first author papers have been published in Nature Genetics and Human Molecular Genetics.

6. GLGC meta-analysis of plasma lipid association study  
    This project involved more than 300,000 samples from 92 studies. I participated in the analysis of ancestry inference, association variants summary and visualization.

### PhD candidate in Peking University, 2006/09 – 2011/07

1. **Phylogeny guided genome alignment method (PGGA)**  
    I developed a method to construct genome alignment and identify duplication and rearrangement in genomes. This method uses a dynamic programming algorithm, and is implemented using C and Perl.

2. **Plant transcription factors database (PlantTFDB)**  
    As one of the major contributors, I participated in the development of a method to identify transcription factors from plant genomes, and constructed PlantTFDB 1.0 and 2.0. PlantTFDB is the most famous database in this area, and it has been cited more than 300 times in total. One first-author paper and two co-author papers have been published on Nucleic Acids Research.

3. **Rice-Map**  
    Rice-Map is a web-based browser used to visualize the genome sequence, gene structure, expression, homology and many other features of the rice genome. Users can browse the genome as browsing a map. I contributed my ideas in the design of the Rice-Map and participated in a part of development.

4. **Evolution and function analysis of DNMT3a and DNMT3b**  
    I performed evolution analysis for DNMT3a and DNMT3b, and identified a positive selected mutation. Our collaborators verified that this mutation plays a key role in the functional divergence of DNMT3a and DNMT3b.

5. **Expression pattern divergence of duplicated genes in rice**  
    I participated in the analysis of gene expression array data from 45 different tissues and conditions in rice development. We found the pattern of expression divergence were different for block duplication, tandem duplication and disperse duplication.
